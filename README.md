# The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating insurance premiums.
# Performed EDA and data Cleaning with various python libraries like pandas , numpy , matplotlib , seaborn.
# Implemented Linear Regression , SVR , Random Forest Regressor and evaluate the results based on training testing data.
# To identidy the relation between each Categorical Variable performed data exploration and obtained visuals with the help of Bi - Variate analysis and identified the pattern in the data.Performed EDA and data Cleaning with various python libraries like pandas , numpy , matplotlib , seaborn.
# Exceuted data preprocessing using label encoding and One Hot Encoding.Obtained the accuracy of 80% with the Linear Regression algorithm.
